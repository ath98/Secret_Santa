# README for Secret Santa Project

## Overview
This README document outlines the structure, functionality, and usage of the provided Python code for implementing Secret Santa.

---

## 1. Employees Documentation

### Key Information:
- **Employees**: Each employee has a `name` (string) and `email` (string).
- **Initialization**: An `Employee` object is created with specific attributes.
- **List Management**: A list of all current employees is maintained to reference when creating assignments.

**Documentation Links:**
- [View Employees List](#)

---

## 2. Secret Santa Assigner Documentation

### Key Information:
- **Assignment Process**: This class assigns secret children (another `Employee` object) to each employee through a while-loop.
- **Algorithm**: The algorithm shuffles employees in two groups, then pairs them up with a random choice from the remaining employees.

## 3. File Operations Documentation

### Key Information:
- **Reading Data**: The `read_csv` method reads employee data from a CSV file.
- **Writing Data**: The `write_to_csv` method writes the secret assignments to another CSV file.

**Documentation Links:**
- [View Read_csv Method](#)
- [View Write_to_csv Method](#)

## 4. Usage Notes

### Best Practices:
- Each employee can only be assigned one secret.
- Employees are processed in a specific order, though details depend on implementation.
- The code is designed to be used with clear documentation and best practices.

## 5. Potential Issues
- **Duplicates**: Duplicate employees may still exist after conversion from list of dictionaries back to the original structure.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider scenarios like empty employee lists or multiple secret assignments per employee, though this should theoretically be prevented.

## 6. Implementation Status

### Current Status:
The code is implemented and functional, ready for use in Secret Santa projects involving employees.

## 7. Dependencies
The implementation uses standard Python libraries like `typing` and `csv`, which are already imported at the top of the file.

## Conclusion

This README provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and modifying the provided code for implementing Secret Santa projects involving employees. The documentation ensures that users have all the necessary information to successfully create, manage, and process employee assignments.
